Trippie\u2019s fluid approach to genre and creative expression caught on with mainstream audiences, with both his 2019 mixtape A Love Letter to You 4 and 2021 studio album Trip at Knight debuting in the upper reaches of the Billboard charts. \nBorn Michael Lamar White IV in 1999 and raised in Canton, Ohio, Trippie Redd was still a teenager when his rap career started. His brother, an aspiring rapper, had died in a car accident when Trippie was just ten, and this tragedy motivated him to live out his departed brother\u2019s dreams. He began releasing mixtapes and videos that would eventually lead him to viral Internet success and a deal with the Universal-distributed label Strainge Entertainment, though he would later sign on with independent label 10K Projects. After working on mixtapes like 2016\u2032s Beast Mode and Awakening My InnerBeast, Trippie Redd delivered his most involved work with 2017\u2032s A Love Letter to You, which reached the Top 100 of the Billboard 200. A Love Letter to You 2 followed the same year and debuted in the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 albums chart. That same month, Trippie joined with Lil Wop for the EP Angels &amp; Demons. Before the end of the year, he scored his first Hot 100 entry with the Travis Scott-assisted single \u201cDark Knight Dummo.\u201d \nIn 2018, Trippie Redd issued several singles in anticipation of his debut studio album, Life's a Trip. The LP placed the artist\u2019s voice at the center of many songs, highlighting his unique vocal style as both a rapper and singer, and became the first in a series of Top Ten Billboard 200 hits. Just a few months later, he returned with the mixtape A Love Letter to You 3, another chapter of depressive and angsty lyrics on both sung and rapped tracks. By now, Trippie had relocated from Ohio, briefly living in Atlanta before landing in Los Angeles. His second studio album, !, arrived in 2019 and immediately topped the Billboard 200. Its title was inspired by the album ? by the late rapper XXXTentacion and continued Trippie\u2019s emo rap musings. \nThe commercial mixtape A Love Letter to You 4 arrived in late 2019, debuting at the top spot on the Billboard charts and racking up over 100 million streams in its first week. An expanded edition of the mixtape was released the next year, with bonus material and new songs that featured artists such as Lil Tecca and Chance the Rapper. This revised version of the wildly successful mixtape set the scene for third studio album Pegasus, which was released in October 2020. The record included cameos from Young Thug, Future, Busta Rhymes, and others and debuted at number two on the Billboard charts. A deluxe version of the album called Neon Shark vs. Pegasus appeared in early 2021, after which Trippie began teasing his fourth LP with the Playboi Carti-assisted single \u201cMiss the Rage.\u201d That album, Trip at Knight, arrived in August 2021. The set included cameo appearances from Drake, Ski Mask the Slump God, SoFaygo, and others, as well as posthumous contributions from Juice WRLD and XXXTentacion. ~ Fred Thomas &amp; Neil Z.

Inspired by MCs such as Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes, Ski Mask has a fast, playful flow, and his cartoonish persona edges slightly toward the morbid. In 2015, he began garnering a following on SoundCloud with tracks like \u201cI Like Bricks\u201d and \u201cKate Moss\u201d before signing a deal with Republic Records and releasing 2017\u2032s \u201cBabyWipe.\u201d He gained even wider exposure when his 2018 mixtape Beware the Book of Eli hit number 50 on the Billboard 200. All of that paved the way for his official debut LP, 2018\u2032s Stokeley, which easily reached the Top Ten. Sin City the Mixtape arrived in 2021. \nBorn Stokeley Goulbourne, he was raised on hip-hop and Jamaican music (his father was also a rapper). In 2013, he met XXXTENTACION at a juvenile detention center, and upon release, they started a group called Very Rare, followed by another one called Members Only. Beginning in 2015, Ski Mask began uploading music to SoundCloud and issued several mixtapes. Tracks such as \u201cI Like Bricks\u201d and \u201cKate Moss\u201d began racking up millions of plays, and he toured with XXXTENTACION and Desiigner. 2016 brought \u201cTake a Step Back\u201d and his self-released debut mixtape, Drown in Designer. The following year, Ski Mask celebrated his 21st birthday with the single \u201cBabyWipe.\u201d The song appeared as part of his deal with Republic Records, which also issued his second mixtape, YouWillRegret. The set featured appearances by XXXTENTACION, MadeinTYO, and DirtyFaceSmook. He followed with the singles \u201cWHOHASIT\u201d and \u201cDoIHaveTheSause?\u201d \nIn 2018, Ski Mask achieved his highest chart placement to date with his third mixtape, Beware the Book of Eli, which landed at number 50 on the Billboard 200. His official debut LP, the fully realized Stokeley, was released later that year, easily reaching the Top Ten. Recruiting guest artists Lil Baby, Lil Yachty, Austin Lam, and Juice WRLD, Stokeley also included production by Murda Beatz and WondaGurl. Ski Mask\u2019s lone release of 2019 was the solo single \u201cCarbonated Water.\u201d The provocative \u201cBurn the Hoods\u201d appeared in mid-2020, addressing issues of racial injustice and social change. In June 2021, Ski Mask\u2019s first collection of new music in several years arrived in the form of Sin City the Mixtape, a short project with nine tracks and a running time just under 20 minutes. The release rose to number 39 on the Billboard charts. ~ Paul Simpson", "linksCountries": ["DE"], "sourceCountry": "US", "createdAtTimestamp": 1587781922562, "refreshedAtTimestamp": 1641558185725}}}, "albums": {}, "tracks": {"860759": {"status": 2, "value": {"type": "track", "id": 860759, "path": "oliver-tree/lifegoeson", "pagePath": "/oliver-tree/lifegoeson", "name": "Life Goes On", "image": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/9a/d8/cd/9ad8cd31-1705-0ffe-e8e1-a1a9187a37f0/075679761132.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpg", "links": {"qobuz": [{"link": "https://open.qobuz.com/track/141534686", "countries": null}], "tidal": [{"link": "https://listen.tidal.com/track/208757616", "countries": ["US"]}], "amazon": [{"link": "https://amazon.com/dp/B09NFG6TS9", "countries": ["US"]}], "deezer": [{"link": "https://www.deezer.com/track/1587094752", "countries": null}], "itunes": [{"link": "https://music.apple.com/{country}/album/life-goes-on-feat-ski-mask-the-slump-god-trippie-redd/1599826303?i=1599826304&app=music", "countries": ["RU"]}], "yandex": [{"link": "https://music.yandex.com/album/20010150/track/97241333", "countries": ["AM", "RU", "AZ", "BY", "GE", "KZ", "KG", "MD", "TJ", "TM", "UZ"]}], "napster": [{"link": "https://napster.com/oliver-tree/life-goes-on-feat-trippie-redd-and-ski-mask-the-slump-god/life-goes-on-feat-trippie-redd-and-ski-mask-the-slump-god", "countries": null}], "pandora": [{"link": "https://www.pandora.com/artist/oliver-tree/life-goes-on-feat-trippie-redd-and-ski-mask-the-slump-god-single-explicit/life-goes-on-feat-trippie-redd-and-ski-mask-the-slump-god/TR2bch6k4lVpwbg", "countries": ["US"]}], "spotify": [{"link": "https://open.spotify.com/track/07ShpyCaAqfCseA3fWFFMY", "countries": ["AD", "AE", "AG", "AL", "AM", "AO", "AR", "AT", "AU", "AZ", "BA", "BB", "BD", "BE", "BF", "BG", "BH", "BI", "BJ", "BN", "BO", "BR", "BS", "BT", "BW", "BY", "BZ", "CA", "CD", "CG", "CH", "CI", "CL", "CM", "CO", "CR", "CV", "CW", "CY", "CZ", "DE", "DJ", "DK", "DM", "DO", "DZ", "EC", "EE", "EG", "ES", "FI", "FJ", "FM", "FR", "GA", "GB", "GD", "GE", "GH", "GM", "GN", "GQ", "GR", "GT", "GW", "GY", "HK", "HN", "HR", "HT", "HU", "ID", "IE", "IL", "IN", "IQ", "IS", "IT", "JM", "JO", "JP", "KE", "KG", "KH", "KI", "KM", "KN", "KR", "KW", "KZ", "LA", "LB", "LC", "LI", "LK", "LR", "LS", "LT", "LU", "LV", "LY", "MA", "MC", "MD", "ME", "MG", "MH", "MK", "ML", "MN", "MO", "MR", "MT", "MU", "MV", "MW", "MX", "MY", "MZ", "NA", "NE", "NG", "NI", "NL", "NO", "NP", "NR", "NZ", "OM", "PA", "PE", "PG", "PH", "PK", "PL", "PS", "PT", "PW", "PY", "QA", "RO", "RS", "RU", "RW", "SA", "SB", "SC", "SE", "SG", "SI", "SK", "SL", "SM", "SN", "SR", "ST", "SV", "SZ", "TD", "TG", "TH", "TJ", "TL", "TN", "TO", "TR", "TT", "TV", "TW", "TZ", "UA", "UG", "US", "UY", "UZ", "VC", "VE", "VN", "VU", "WS", "XK", "ZA", "ZM", "ZW"]}], "youtube": [{"link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=DR-Lfe56Ks0", "countries": null}], "audiomack": [{"link": "https://audiomack.com/song/olivertree/life-goes-on-with-trippie-redd-and-ski-mask", "countries": null}], "soundcloud": [{"link": "https://soundcloud.com/olivertree/life-goes-on-feat-trippie-redd-ski-mask-the-slump-god?id=1178975659", "countries": null}], "amazonMusic": [{"link": "https://music.amazon.com/albums/B09NFDVW9P?trackAsin=B09NFG6TS9", "countries": ["US"]}], "itunesStore": [{"link": "https://music.apple.com/{country}/album/life-goes-on-feat-ski-mask-the-slump-god-trippie-redd/1599826303?i=1599826304&app=itunes", "countries": ["RU"]}], "youtubeMusic": [{"link": "https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=DR-Lfe56Ks0", "countries": null}]}, "linksCountries": ["RU"], "sourceCountry": "US", "refreshedAtTimestamp": 1646163690245, "createdAtTimestamp": 1643518291634, "artistIds": [157865, 96019, 365514]}}}, "session": {"hydrated": true, "user": {}, "isProduction": true, "baseUrl": "https://songwhip.com", "country": "RU", "language": "en", "deviceType": "large"}, "paths": {"oliver-tree/lifegoeson": {"status": 2, "value": {"type": "track", "id": 860759}}, "oliver-tree": {"status": 2, "value": {"type": "artist", "id": 157865}}, "trippie-redd": {"status": 2, "value": {"type": "artist", "id": 96019}}, "skimasktheslumpgod": {"status": 2, "value": {"type": "artist", "id": 365514}}}}}, "page": "/[param1]/[param2]", "query": {"bypass_edge_cache": "1", "param2": "lifegoeson", "country": "RU", "_vercel_no_cache": "1", "device": "large", "param1": "oliver-tree"}, "buildId": "ad4ff8c67d1bff094c966ec3065e33fbae668386", "assetPrefix": "https://songwhip.com", "isFallback": false, "dynamicIds": [49618], "gip": true, "appGip": true}
